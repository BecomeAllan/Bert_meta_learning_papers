Our vision in Google Brain's Machine Learning for Systems team is to use AI to transform the way in which computer systems and chips are designed. Many core problems in systems and hardware design are combinatorial optimization or decision making tasks with state and action spaces that are orders of magnitude larger than that of standard AI benchmarks in robotics and games. In this talk, we will describe some of our latest learning based approaches to tackling such large-scale optimization problems. We will discuss our work on a new domain-transferable reinforcement learning (RL) method for optimizing chip placement [1], a long pole in hardware design. Our approach is capable of learning from past experience and improving over time, resulting in more optimized placements on unseen chip blocks as the RL agent is exposed to a larger volume of data. Our objective is to minimize power, performance, and area. We show that, in under six hours, our method can generate placements that are superhuman or comparable on modern accelerator chips, whereas existing baselines require human experts in the loop and can take several weeks.","Reinforcement Learning for Placement Optimization.

11,114,Training human decision making for disruption of cognitive RF,"Cognitive radio frequency (RF) technique is RF spectrum management and spectrum optimization. In a military context, particularly in a contested electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), RF spectrum management could occur through the use of adaptive artificial intelligence. The use of the EMS for command and control can be disrupted by a variety of threats even when cognitive RF techniques are employed. This potential for disruption means that human intervention may be needed at times in order to maintain an adequate level of command and control. This presentation will provide an overview of the dual-process framework of human decision making and how it would relate to training humans for this kind of intervention. This framework indicates that decision making by humans is composed of a blend of two complementary systems or modes of operation: an analytical system and an intuitive system. The analytical system permits abstract reasoning and deliberation, but it is constrained by working memory capacity. In comparison, the intuitive system is based on situational pattern recognition and is not constrained by working memory capacity. In this presentation it will be suggested that the intuitive decision-making system, because it is based on pattern recognition, is ideal for training humans to intervene when command and control is disrupted.","Training human decision making for disruption of cognitive RF.

The use of the EMS for command and control can be disrupted by a variety of threats even when cognitive RF techniques are employed. This potential for disruption means that human intervention may be needed at times in order to maintain an adequate level of command and control. This presentation will provide an overview of the dual-process framework of human decision making and how it would relate to training humans for this kind of intervention.

 Abstract
 
 Our work has been carried out with the aim of providing a solution to decision-making problems encountered in information systems for supply chains in crisis situation. The supply chain represents a competitive advantage that companies seek to perpetuate. It aims to optimize the exchanges, or flows, that the company maintains with its suppliers and its customers. These flows can be of various natures. It can be information flows relating to supplies or product design, financial flows linked to purchases, or even flows of goods. The crisis management logistics is getting more and more attention, especially in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For these systems, where it is never very easy to anticipate the evolution of the environment, the forms of changes undergone are varied and rapid. We aim to provide an answer to these challenges, in an approach that links optimization methods to the paradigm of artificial intelligence. We therefore propose to find mathematical models, and inter-agent cooperation protocols, to minimize the risk of stock shortage in any area of ​​the supply chain.

16,105,Multi-objective interior design optimization method based on sustainability concepts for post-disaster temporary housing units,"Abstract Temporary housing units (THUs), which are provided after disasters, are crucial in terms of sustainability pillars (economic, social, and environmental). In general, THUs, which are regular houses with minimum space and facilities, incorporate some negative aspects of the building industry. Additionally, as large numbers of THUs are usually provided in a short time and under emergency situations, some negative impacts of these units escalate. In this context, this study aims at reducing some negative impacts of THUs by applying a novel optimization model that maximises sustainability indexes by simulating the design of interior geometries for THUs. This method is based on the coupling of artificial intelligence and a multi-criteria decision-making model for sustainability assessment. The proposed model generates optimal solutions using a backtracking algorithm together with a binary search. To evaluate the sustainability indexes, an Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessment (MIVES) is applied. This novel method enables decision makers to automatically generate the most suitable alternative solutions for the early design stage of THUs. The results confirm that small changes in the interior geometric design can remarkably affect the sustainability indexes of THUs.","Multi-objective interior design optimization method based on sustainability concepts for post-disaster temporary housing units.

In Fuzzy Logic Inferencing for PONG (FLIP), the effectiveness of type 1 logic is examined as an optimal controller for players in the game of PONG. Robotic collaboration is also developed as the PONG game was expanded into a multiplayer option. Collaborative Learning using Fuzzy Inferencing (CLIFF) is an extension of this PONG game, however type-2 logic is used to create a robotic coach that optimizes its players to beat its opponent in a development of layered fuzzy learning. Precision Route Optimization using Fuzzy Intelligence (PROFIT) examines the use of fuzzy logic as an optimizer in an algorithmic solution to a modified Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is modified in a way to better mimic a real-life scenario where footprints must be visited instead of simply points, which gives an interesting complexity to the problem.

31,79,Applying artificial intelligence modeling to optimize green roof irrigation,"Abstract Recent increase in green-roof installation has increased irrigation water consumption which could be wasteful using conventional watering management protocol. The knowledge gap in irrigation optimization to achieve water conservation could be filled. The complicated conventional approach uses weather and soil sensors to calculate watering needs, which is impractical and not cost-effective. This study employs artificial intelligence algorithms composed of artificial neural network and fuzzy logic, using weather data to simulate soil moisture changes to develop an optimal irrigation strategy. The artificial neural network is trained to predict soil moisture based on four daily weather variables: real-time air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed. Fuzzy-neural network is applied to determine the irrigation time and watering volume. The simulation model successfully mimics the human brain in making irrigation decision. The artificial intelligence irrigation could maintain adequate soil moisture ranging from 0.13 to 0.22 m 3 /m 3 and reduce 20% of water use with improved plant coverage. Since the evapotranspiration from living vegetation plays a key role in the passive cooling mechanism, better plant coverage could increase the thermal-energy performance of green roofs. The low-cost and effective technique can motivate the adoption of green roofs by alleviating the water consumption obstacle.","Applying artificial intelligence modeling to optimize green roof irrigation.

42,64,Analysis of Fleet Modularity in an Artificial Intelligence Based Defender-Attacker Game,"Because combat environments change over time and technology upgrades are widespread for ground vehicles, a large number of vehicles and equipment become quickly obsolete. A possible solution for the U.S. Army is to develop fleets of modular military vehicles, which are built by interchangeable substantial components also known as modules.

Moreover, military demands are time-varying and highly stochastic because commanders keep reacting to enemy’s actions. To capture these characteristics, we formulated an intelligent agent-based model to imitate decision making process during fleet operation, which combines real-time optimization with artificial intelligence.

44,59,Analysis of Fleet Modularity in an Artificial Intelligence-Based Attacker-Defender Game,"Because combat environments change over time and technology upgrades are widespread for ground vehicles, a large number of vehicles and equipment become quickly obsolete. A possible solution for the U.S. Army is to develop fleets of modular military vehicles, which are built by interchangeable substantial components also known as modules. One of the typical characteristics of module is their ease of assembly and disassembly through simple means such as plug-in/pull-out actions, which allows for real-time fleet reconfiguration to meet dynamic demands. Moreover, military demands are time-varying and highly stochastic because commanders keep reacting to enemy's actions. To capture these characteristics, we formulated an intelligent agent-based model to imitate decision making process during fleet operation, which combines real-time optimization with artificial intelligence. The agents are capable of inferring enemy's future move based on historical data and optimize dispatch/operation decisions accordingly. We implement our model to simulate an attacker-defender game between two adversarial and intelligent players, representing the commanders from modularized fleet and conventional fleet respectively. Given the same level of combat resources and intelligence, we highlight the tactical advantages of fleet modularity in terms of win rate, unpredictability and suffered damage.","Analysis of Fleet Modularity in an Artificial Intelligence-Based Attacker-Defender Game.

60,28,Can Artificial Intelligence Help Optimize the Public Budgeting Process? Lessons about Smartness and Public Value from the Mexican Federal Government,"Public budgeting is at the core of any government, since decisions about how to use resources affect all areas of public policy and government programs. With emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, new opportunities may exist to improve the public budgeting process. Although recent research has focused on many topics related to public budgeting, there is still a gap in terms of our knowledge about the potential role of artificial intelligence techniques. While the potential advantages of using intelligent algorithms for optimization in the private sector have been studied, there are also potential benefits that are unique to the public sector, particularly in terms of improved decision-making. This study proposes a methodology based on artificial intelligence to explore the optimization of the Mexican federal government's public budget distribution. The main outcomes explored are related to social development, economic development, government, and non-programmed budget items. The findings indicate that investment in social development in Mexico should be increased and the non-program-based budget should be reduced. We acknowledge that many other factors influence the allocation of public budgets to different policy domains and specific government programs, including political and environmental variables, but think it is useful to have a proposed “optimal” solution to better understand the differences between policy priorities and budget allocations and the causes of those differences.","Can Artificial Intelligence Help Optimize the Public Budgeting Process?
